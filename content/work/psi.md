# Overview

At Phoenix Silicon International Corporation, I led a comprehensive transformation of the company's electronic wafer mapping (eMap) infrastructure. This project involved replacing legacy systems with modern, high-performance solutions that dramatically improved operational efficiency and cost savings.

## System Overhaul Project

Led the complete overhaul of the electronic wafer map (eMap) system, replacing 30+ legacy programs, achieving a 90x improvement in processing speed, saving the company tens of thousands annually. This massive undertaking required careful planning, phased implementation, and extensive testing to ensure zero downtime during the transition.

## Database Engineering

Engineered a scalable relational database that reduced data storage by 50%, minimized overhead, enhanced consistency, and ensured long-term operational scalability. The new database architecture significantly improved data integrity and query performance across the organization.

## Processing Pipeline Optimization

Designed and implemented a high-performance E-Map processing pipeline that optimizes resource utilization, reducing scheduling trigger time by 92% and significantly enhancing operational efficiency. This pipeline became a critical component of the company's manufacturing workflow.
