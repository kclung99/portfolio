# Overview

ðŸ˜Ž During my time at SecuX Technology, I spearheaded multiple high-impact initiatives that significantly enhanced the company's blockchain wallet solutions and backend infrastructure. My work directly contributed to substantial revenue growth and operational improvements.

## Blockchain Network Expansion

Spearheaded the expansion of blockchain network support in the company's cold-wallet application, doubling supported networks within six months, resulting in 34% overall transaction volume growth. This involved deep integration with various blockchain protocols and ensuring secure transaction handling across multiple networks.

## Swap Service Development

Directed backend development of a new swap service generating tens of thousands in monthly revenue, architecting a universal provider interface and overseeing the full transaction pipeline and asset handling. The service enables seamless cryptocurrency exchanges within the wallet ecosystem.

## Performance Optimization

Optimized backend performance by implementing concurrency mechanisms and caching strategies, reducing request overhead by 50% and achieving nearly 20x throughput improvement. These optimizations significantly enhanced user experience and system scalability.

## DID System Development

Developed a decentralized identification (DID) system, contributing to system architecture, deployment, and testing, which secured two government-funded projects valued at tens of thousands annually. This work positioned the company at the forefront of decentralized identity solutions.
