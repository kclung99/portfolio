# Overview

This project addresses a critical healthcare challenge by developing an intelligent system for monitoring and assessing limb conditions in elderly populations. Combining advanced computer vision, machine learning algorithms, and user-centered design principles, the system provides healthcare professionals with accurate, non-invasive tools for early detection and continuous monitoring of age-related mobility issues.

## Healthcare Challenge

Age-related limb conditions and mobility issues are increasingly prevalent in aging populations worldwide. Early detection and continuous monitoring are crucial for maintaining quality of life and preventing serious complications. However, traditional assessment methods are often subjective, time-consuming, and require specialized expertise that may not be readily available in all healthcare settings.

## AI-Powered Solution

The developed system utilizes advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze limb movement patterns, identify potential issues, and provide objective assessments. The AI algorithms were trained on diverse datasets to ensure accuracy across different demographics and condition types, enabling reliable detection of early-stage mobility issues that might be missed by conventional methods.

## User-Centered Design

Beyond technical innovation, the project emphasized user experience design, ensuring the system is accessible and intuitive for both healthcare professionals and elderly users. The interface design considers the specific needs and limitations of elderly users, incorporating principles of accessibility and ease of use without compromising on functionality or accuracy.

## Recognition and Impact

The project's success was recognized with dual awards: Gold Medal for technical excellence and Best Product Design for innovation in user experience. This recognition from the international invention and design community validates both the technical merit of the AI system and its potential for real-world healthcare applications, demonstrating how technology can be effectively designed to serve vulnerable populations.
